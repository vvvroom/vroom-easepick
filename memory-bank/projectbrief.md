# Project Brief: easepick

## Overview
easepick is a lightweight, zero-dependency JavaScript date picker library built with modern web standards. The library provides a flexible, plugin-based architecture for creating customizable date selection interfaces.

## Core Mission
To provide developers with a powerful, extensible date picker solution that prioritizes performance, accessibility, and ease of integration while maintaining a small footprint and avoiding external dependencies.

## Key Characteristics
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure JavaScript/TypeScript with no external runtime dependencies
- **Shadow DOM**: Uses modern web component standards for style encapsulation
- **Plugin Architecture**: Modular system allowing feature extensions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized as multiple npm packages for flexible consumption
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and developer experience

## Scope
- Core date picker functionality (single date selection)
- Plugin system supporting various extensions (range selection, time picking, presets, etc.)
- Multiple output formats and localization support
- Responsive design with customizable styling
- Accessibility compliance

## Success Criteria
- Small bundle size (< 50KB gzipped for core)
- Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- Plugin ecosystem enabling feature-rich date picking
- Cross-browser compatibility (modern browsers)
- Active maintenance and community support

## Current Status
Version 1.2.1 - Production ready with established plugin ecosystem
